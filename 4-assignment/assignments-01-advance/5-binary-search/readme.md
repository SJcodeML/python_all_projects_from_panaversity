bianry search has conditon array (elements) should be sorted but in linear search it is not compulsory 

best case of a binary search: means apne mid nikala or mid he apka target h 


Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific element in a **sorted** array or list. It operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, which makes it much faster than linear search for large datasets. Here’s how it works:

### How Binary Search Works:

1. **Initial Setup**: Begin with two pointers—one pointing to the start of the array (let’s call it `low`) and the other pointing to the end of the array (`high`).

2. **Calculate the Middle**: Find the middle index of the current range:
   \[
   \text{mid} = \text{low} + \frac{(\text{high} - \text{low})}{2}
   \]

3. **Compare Values**:
   - If the value at the middle index (`array[mid]`) equals the target value, you’ve found the target.
   - If the target value is less than `array[mid]`, adjust the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search the left half of the array.
   - If the target value is greater, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search the right half.

4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the target value is found or the `low` pointer exceeds the `high` pointer, which means the target is not in the array.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of binary search is \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is significantly faster than linear search's \(O(n)\).

### Example in Python:

Here's a simple implementation of binary search in Python:

```python
def binary_search(array, target):
    low, high = 0, len(array) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif array[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1  # Search right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1  # Search left half
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Use Cases:
- Binary search is used in various applications, including searching for elements in databases, implementing search algorithms in programming languages, and in situations where quick lookups are necessary.
